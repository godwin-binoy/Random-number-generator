# Random Number Generator

## Overview
This project is a simple program written in Python that generates random numbers. You can choose the range of numbers you want, and the program will randomly pick a number from that range. It also checks to make sure you give correct inputs, so it works smoothly.



## Features
- You can choose the smallest and largest numbers for the range.
- The program will randomly pick a number within your range.
- It checks your inputs to make sure they are numbers.
- You can reset the range or exit the program whenever you want.



## What You Need
To run this program, you need:
- **Python 3.x** installed on your computer.



## How to Install
1. Get the program from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/godwin-binoy/Random-number-generator.git
   ```
2. Go to the folder where the program is saved:
   ```bash
   cd Random-number-generator
   ```



## How to Use It
1. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python3 "random number generator.py"
   ```
2. Follow the instructions on the screen:
   - Enter the smallest and largest numbers for the range.
   - See the random numbers it generates.
   - Reset the range or exit the program if needed.

### Example of What It Looks Like
```
Random Number Generator
-----------------------

Enter Lowest number : 10
Enter Highest number : 100

Random number : 45

Enter 'reset' to reset highest and lowest number
Enter 'exit' to exit
Enter to generate another number :
```



## How It Works
This program uses Python's `random` module to generate random numbers. It runs in a loop, so you can keep generating numbers until you decide to stop. It also checks your inputs to make sure you enter valid numbers, and it won’t let you continue if the smallest number is bigger than the largest number.
